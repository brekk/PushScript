== WHAT IS PUSHSCRIPT? ==

PushScript is a simple JavaScript implementation of the Push language which
runs in web-browsers.  Push is a stack-based interpreted language designed
for evolutionary computation.  PushScript can allow users to run genetic 
programming experiments directly in a web-broswer.  

Details on the Push language are available here:

http://hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html


== WHAT CAN PUSHSCRIPT DO? ==

PushScript can run interpreted programs in a web-browser as part of a 
distributed genetic programming run.  In conjunction with AJAX, PushScript
can be used to download programs, evaluate them, and then upload the 
results back to a server.


== WHAT CAN'T PUSHSCRIPT DO? ==

Though PushScript can be used to evalute programs for genetic programming
experiments, it does not include a full genetic programming environment.  It
currently lacks genetic operators and population control functionality 
typically found in such environments.  Currently such tasks must be done 
by the server.


== DOCUMENTATION AND VERSION HISTORY ==

This is the initial release of PushScript, version 0.1.  There is currently 
no documentation, but the file push.js is small and should be easy to 
understand.  Please contact the author with any questions.


== WHO WROTE PUSHSCRIPT? ==

PushScript was written by Jon Klein (jk [at] spiderland.org), based on the 
Push language design specification by Lee Spector 
(lspector [at] hampshire.edu).


== WHAT HAS PUSHSCRIPT BEEN USED FOR? ==

Please see the following paper for information on how PushScript has been
used to solve genetic programming problems.
